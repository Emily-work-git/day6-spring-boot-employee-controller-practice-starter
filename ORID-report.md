### ORID Report - Emily

#### Objective: What Did We Learn Today?
Today, we learned about Spring and Spring Boot, focusing on integration testing and using Spring Boot annotations. 
We also practiced pair programming, which helped us solve problems together and learn from each other.

#### Reflective: My Feelings
I enjoyed pairing with my teammate; it was a fun way to learn. However, I felt frustrated when I couldn't fix a problem with test cases running in parallel. It turned out to be a constructor issue because I wasn't familiar with Spring Boot yet.

#### Interpretive: Why?
The difficulties I faced showed me how important it is to understand Spring Boot better. My frustration came from not knowing enough about the framework. Luckily, working with a partner made it easier to find solutions and boosted my confidence.

#### Direction: Action Points - What Changes Will I Make?
Going forward, I plan to spend more time learning about Spring Boot. Iâ€™ll look for tutorials and resources to improve my skills. I also want to keep doing pair programming, as it helps me learn and feel supported.
